## Creation process week by week

In the first week, we worked in groups, divided the tasks and designed the project in Figma.
In the second week, we started working individually, we started with html structuring the page with its semantic elements.
Third week we corrected the HTML errors to structure and began to style the page with CSS, this week we could not use Flexbox.
Fourth week we continue with CSS improving the styles and being able to use Flexbox, this week we focus on the different resolutions and start a mobile first focus.
In the fifth week we are working on Javascript and doing exercises touching on various topics such as variables, arrays, loops and functions.
This week the problematic is about validation with JavaScript, we did the login and sign up with all its corresponding validation.
